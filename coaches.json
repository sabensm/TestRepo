    "bio": "My journey started in 2008 as a developer on a Scrum team. Agile immediately resonated with my values and principles, and I grew my skill sets to become a scrum master and agile coach to improve the delivery capabilities across entire organizations. I like to leverage the power of analogies and memorable quotes to simplify complex concepts, as well as add a touch of humor to demonstrate that fun and hard work do not have to be mutually exclusive."

I have 10 years of experience in coaching individuals, teams, and enterprises with agile, lean, and other core competencies. One of my favorite approaches for creating lasting change is to cultivate communities of practice that thrive. These communities take ownership for their practices and continuously improve them to achieve greater success."
